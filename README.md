State of Decay 2 Editor and Dataviewer

Should work with the final version of SoD2 for either Steam or MS/Gamepass.

Launch the game, launch the tool, click Connect, it'll find it in memory.  If it fails, make sure that the tool's being launched at the same permission level as the game, or just run it as admin to bypass most of those issues.
